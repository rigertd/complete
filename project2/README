Project 2 README

1) When running project2.py be sure to include a command line argument for the file you intend to read from.
    a) Case matters for the file name
    b) Be sure to include the extension (.txt)
    c) Each line should be alternating array of coin values, and total change values
2) Change slow runs... well... slow. If you are testing high values of A you need to remove changeslow from the run.
    a) To do this, remove the # comment signts at the start of lines 132 and 139 of the code.
