Brief Description of Program Testing

I tested my program with the following input file conditions.

    - The same number of values in each file
    - More values in the first file
    - More values in the second file
    - All values are unique
    - Duplicate values between the files
    - Duplicate values in the same file
    - Highest value in the first file
    - Highest value in the second file
    - One empty input file
    - Two empty input files

This provides coverage of all valid number combinations in the input files.
If any invalid data is encountered, the program stops reading that file.
