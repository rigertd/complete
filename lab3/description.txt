Brief Description of Program Testing

I tested my program with the following numbers in the input files.

    - The same number of values in each file, and all values are unique
    - More values in the first file, and all values are unique
    - More values in the second file, and all values are unique
    - More values in the second file, and duplicate values between the files
    - More values in the second file, and duplicate values in the same file

This provides coverage of all valid number combinations in the input files.
If any invalid data is encountered, the program stops reading that file.
