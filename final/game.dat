##ROOMDESCRIPTION##
You are deep in the inner chamber of an ancient temple. You managed to get past
countless traps and creatures on your way down, but it took way longer than you
expected. The entrance of the temple locks itself shut in only 10 more minutes. 
Hurry up and get out while you still can!
The room has only one exit to the north.
